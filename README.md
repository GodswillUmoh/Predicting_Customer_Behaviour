# Predicting_Customer_Behaviour
We are using Logistics Regression approach here where the dependent variable predicts a categorical outcome whether a customer will purchase a product or not

## Dataset
_The First 15 rows of about 100 rows of data is displayed in the table_

|Age|	Estimated Salary|	Purchased|
|----|-----------------|---------|
|19|	19000|	0|
|35	|20000	|0|
|26|	43000|	0|
|27	|57000	|0|
|19|	76000|	0|
|27	|58000	|0|
|27|	84000|	0|
|32	|150000	|1|
|25|	33000|	0|
|35	|65000	|0|
|26|	80000|	0|
|26	|52000	|0|
|20|	86000|	0|
|32	|18000	|0|

## About the Dataset
_The dataset is used to predict a categorical variable of Yes and No where the categories are encoded to be 1 (for Yes) and 0 (for No). This is to use the variable Age and Estimated Salary as the predictors._

## Case Scenario
Your company where you work as a data scientist just released a new brand of furniture, and your role is to predict which of your customers can purchased the product. The result will help the advertising team target thr right customers that will buy the new product.

## Model used
This model uses the Logistics Regression algorithm to carryout the prediction.
